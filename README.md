Step 1: Think of an idea
StarClick: A simpler application where users can click on points on a star to see their values (like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) displayed as text on the screen. This keeps the core concept without complex interactions.

Step 2: Reflect
Fantastic! That sounds like a well scoped project. We have some questions to help you think about your project idea. Take some time to think about them and write your answers below.

Feel free to write as much or as little as you want, or to say if you're not sure about anything. The more accurate your answers are, the better we can help you come up with a plan.

That's a cool idea! How do you imagine the star looking on the screen? For example, do you want it to be a five-pointed star, or something more complex?

I want it to be a star with 5 points and when clicking, it displays the values ​​of each point

Great choice! Where would you like the values to be displayed? Do you want them to appear near the clicked point on the star or perhaps in a designated area on the screen?

It would be interesting both ways and if possible storing the values ​​that were clicked

Sounds good! How do you want to handle the display of the clicked values? Should they be stored in a list and shown all together, perhaps in a specific area on the screen, or would you prefer each value to be displayed individually as you click on each star point?

It seems interesting to me so that the values ​​are stored for each interaction with each point of the star

Awesome! Have you thought about any specific colors or styles for the star and the text that appears? This might help in making the display more visually appealing.

the star must be yellow and its texts must be silver

Anything else we should know when building milestones?

To ensure that the click event is always guaranteed to the canvas after a reset
