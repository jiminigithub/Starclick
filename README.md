Step 1: Think of an idea
StarClick: A simpler application where users can click on points on a star to see their values (like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) displayed as text on the screen. This keeps the core concept without complex interactions.

Step 2: Reflect
Fantastic! That sounds like a well scoped project. We have some questions to help you think about your project idea. Take some time to think about them and write your answers below.

Feel free to write as much or as little as you want, or to say if you're not sure about anything. The more accurate your answers are, the better we can help you come up with a plan.

That's a cool idea! How do you imagine the star looking on the screen? For example, do you want it to be a five-pointed star, or something more complex?

I want it to be a star with 5 points and when clicking, it displays the values ​​of each point

Great choice! Where would you like the values to be displayed? Do you want them to appear near the clicked point on the star or perhaps in a designated area on the screen?

It would be interesting both ways and if possible storing the values ​​that were clicked

Sounds good! How do you want to handle the display of the clicked values? Should they be stored in a list and shown all together, perhaps in a specific area on the screen, or would you prefer each value to be displayed individually as you click on each star point?

It seems interesting to me so that the values ​​are stored for each interaction with each point of the star

Awesome! Have you thought about any specific colors or styles for the star and the text that appears? This might help in making the display more visually appealing.

the star must be yellow and its texts must be silver

Anything else we should know when building milestones?

To ensure that the click event is always guaranteed to the canvas after a reset

Step 3: Plan Milestones
There are many ways to approach your project, but here's one. If you need some help getting started, here's a guide to help you through the process. You can mark each step as completed as you go.

Of course, feel free to take your own path. It's the journey that matters, not the destination.

Define the Project Scope and Plan
Start by breaking down the project into manageable parts. For example, draw the star, detect clicks on the star, and display values when the star points are clicked. Write a plan that outlines each task you need to complete to make the project successful.

Draw the Star
Use the graphics library to draw a five-pointed star on the screen. You might want to start by figuring out the coordinates for each point of the star and use these to create your shape.

Lesson: Graphics
Detect Clicks on the Star
Add functionality to detect clicks on the star. You'll need to determine whether a click happened within one of the points on the star.

Lesson: Animation
Worked Example: Mouse Tracker
Display Values Near Clicked Points
When a star point is clicked, display the corresponding value. You might want to draw the text near the clicked point or in a designated area on the screen. Make sure the text color is silver as per your specifications.

Store and Display Clicked Values
Store each clicked value in a list and display all collected values in a specific area of the screen. This will require some logic to add each value to the list and update the display accordingly.

Here are some resources that might help you with this step:
Reading: Lists
Lesson: Lists
Enhance the Visual Appeal
Add colors and styles to the star and text. Ensure the star is yellow and the text is silver. Play around with different fonts and sizes to make the display more visually appealing.

Here are some resources that might help you with this step:
Worked Example: Exploring Colors
Test and Refine
Test your program to ensure all functions work correctly. Make sure clicks are detected properly, values are displayed, and everything is visually appealing. Make any necessary refinements to complete the project.

Optional: Advanced Features
If time permits, consider adding additional features such as animating the click interactions or adding a reset button to clear the displayed values. Use your creativity to elevate your project!

Here are some resources that might help you with this step:
Reading: Animation
Here are some terms you might need to know for this step:
Animation: Creating a sequence of images or frames to simulate motion. In this context, it refers to making elements on the screen move or change over time.
